description: "Comparing PM2 and Docker for deployment, which one to use when you need to set up something fast or when you need to scale up"
---

When it comes to deploying applications, developers often face the decision of choosing the right tool for the job. Two popular options are **PM2** and **Docker**, each serving distinct purposes while overlapping in some deployment scenarios. In this blog, we'll explore what PM2 and Docker are, why they're needed, and how they compare for simple setups and scaling.

## What is PM2?

PM2 (Process Manager 2) is a process manager for Node.js applications. It’s a lightweight tool designed to keep your applications running, manage processes, and handle tasks like restarting crashed apps, load balancing, and monitoring. PM2 is particularly popular among Node.js developers for its simplicity and ease of use.

### Why Use PM2?
- **Process Management**: Ensures your app stays alive by automatically restarting it if it crashes.
- **Load Balancing**: Distributes traffic across multiple instances of your app (using its cluster mode).
- **Zero-Downtime Reloads**: Allows you to update your app without stopping it.
- **Monitoring**: Provides basic CPU/memory usage stats and logs.

PM2 shines in scenarios where you’re deploying a Node.js app on a single server and need a quick, reliable way to manage it.

## What is Docker?

Docker is a containerization platform that packages your application, its dependencies, and configurations into a single, portable unit called a container. Containers run consistently across different environments (e.g., development, testing, production) because they encapsulate everything the app needs to function.

### Why Use Docker?
- **Consistency**: Eliminates "it works on my machine" issues by standardizing environments.
- **Isolation**: Runs multiple apps on the same server without conflicts.
- **Portability**: Easily move containers between servers, clouds, or local machines.
- **Ecosystem**: Integrates with orchestration tools like Kubernetes for complex deployments.

Docker is ideal for projects requiring multiple services (e.g., app server, database, cache) or deployments across diverse environments.

## PM2 vs. Docker: Key Differences

| Feature                | PM2                          | Docker                       |
|------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Purpose**            | Process management          | Containerization            |
| **Scope**              | Node.js apps                | Any app/language            |
| **Environment**        | Runs directly on the OS     | Runs in isolated containers |
| **Setup Complexity**   | Simple                      | Moderate                    |
| **Resource Overhead**  | Low                         | Higher (due to containers)  |
| **Scaling**            | Limited (single server)     | Advanced (multi-server)     |

## Which One is Better for a Simple Setup?

For a **simple setup**—say, deploying a single Node.js app on one server—**PM2** is the better choice. Here’s why:
- **Ease of Use**: PM2 requires minimal configuration. Install it with `npm install -g pm2`, run your app with `pm2 start app.js`, and you’re done.
- **Lightweight**: It doesn’t introduce the overhead of containers, making it faster to set up and run.
- **Quick Monitoring**: Built-in tools let you check logs and performance with commands like `pm2 logs` or `pm2 monit`.

Docker, while powerful, adds complexity for a basic deployment. You’d need to write a `Dockerfile`, build an image, and manage containers—overkill for a single app on a single machine.

**Winner for Simple Setup**: PM2

## Which One is Better for Scaling?

When it comes to **scaling**, **Docker** takes the lead. Here’s why:
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Docker integrates seamlessly with orchestration tools like Kubernetes or Docker Swarm, allowing you to deploy and manage containers across multiple servers effortlessly.
- **Service Isolation**: Each component (e.g., app, database) runs in its own container, making it easier to scale specific parts of your system independently.
- **Cloud-Friendly**: Most cloud providers (AWS, Google Cloud, etc.) offer native support for Docker, simplifying large-scale deployments.

PM2, on the other hand, is limited in scaling capabilities:
- **Cluster Mode**: PM2’s cluster mode can spin up multiple instances of your app, but it’s restricted to a single server and relies on the machine’s CPU cores.
- **No Multi-Server Support**: Managing PM2 across multiple servers requires manual setup or third-party tools, which isn’t as streamlined as Docker’s ecosystem.

**Winner for Scaling**: Docker

## Can You Use PM2 and Docker Together?

Yes! In fact, combining them is a common practice. You can run PM2 inside a Docker container to manage your Node.js app’s processes while leveraging Docker’s containerization benefits. For example:
1. Use Docker to package your app and its dependencies.
2. Use PM2 inside the container to ensure the app stays running and handles restarts.

This hybrid approach gives you the best of both worlds: PM2’s process management and Docker’s portability/scaling.

## Conclusion

- **Choose PM2** if you’re deploying a simple Node.js app on a single server and want a lightweight, straightforward solution.
- **Choose Docker** if you need consistency across environments, plan to scale horizontally, or are working with a multi-service architecture.

For a small project with no immediate scaling needs, PM2 is the quicker and simpler option. But if growth is on the horizon, Docker’s flexibility and ecosystem make it the smarter long-term investment. And if you’re unsure? Start with PM2, and transition to Docker (with PM2 inside) as your needs evolve.

Happy deploying!
